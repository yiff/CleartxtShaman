# CleartxtShaman

Use:

```
Windows
-------
Download and run the .exe file!
```

```
Linux
-------
Download the CleartxtShaman file, right click it, go to properties and make sure to allow it to run as a program. Then, from your terminal, type ./CleartxtShaman to run it. You can also rename it to anything you'd like and drop it in your /home/user/.local/bin folder to be able to run it from anywhere like a built-in terminal application. I personally liked the idea of putting it in my bin and naming it 'cts' so I could open up my terminal any-time and type cts to get it up. You do you, though. It's just an executable CLI program that runs in the terminal.
